<H1>Hi there 👋</H1>

I am Dengyun Peng, a **first-year Master's student** at **HIT** and a member of the **SCIR LA**.
I am currently under the supervision of Professor Wanxiang Che, Professor Libo Qin and Ph.D. candidate Qiguang Chen.
My current research interests focus on **RL4LLM**, **LLM reasoning**. I have research experience in **Safe RL** and **Offline RL**.
