## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior BS @HIT and also an incoming MS @HIT, a member of the SCIR LA.

I used to be an intern at Westlake University.

My current research interests focus on the combination of LLM and RL. I have research experience in Safe RL and Offline RL.

I used to live in Zhengzhou, Weihai and Hangzhou.
